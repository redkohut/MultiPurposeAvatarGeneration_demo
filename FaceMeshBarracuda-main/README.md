**FaceMeshBarracuda** is a lightweight facial capture package for Unity that
provides a neural network predictor pipeline to generate the approximate
geometry of a human face.

FaceMeshBarracuda is heavily based on the [MediaPipe Face Mesh] package.
Although it is not a straight port of the original package, it uses the same
pre-trained models and structures.
